## Benefits of Local Images

Using local images instead of loading from external URLs provides several benefits:

1. **Faster loading**: No need to download images from the internet each time
2. **Works offline**: The application can function without an internet connection
3. **More reliable**: No dependency on external services being available
4. **No CORS issues**: Eliminates cross-origin resource sharing complications
