            <p>
              Project Art of Humanity provides enormous digital canvases that would be nearly impossible to fully paint
              by one person. We have developed a collaboration system that will allow the creation of the most stunning
              art pieces the world has ever seen. Anyone can paint a part of the canvas and solidify your spot in
              history!
